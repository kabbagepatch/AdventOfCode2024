The first part was pretty simple, though I really wanted to not use just a bunch of arrays and have loops nested within loops. But we are working with small arrays here. It's fine. Just had to go over each number, and check the numbers ahead and see if they violate any rules. The rules, I used a map to simplify.

For part two, it was a bit more tricky. We needed to fix the list. It took a couple different ways in my head before I even commited to updating the code. Once again, I didn't wanna keep nesting loops. My initial thought, to delete an out-of-order element from the list, and insert it in it's right place (at least the right place as far as I know so far in the list) would've probably wrorked better with linked lists. But then I realised, I can just replace whatever's in the "right" place with the current element and just go over the list again starting from the current element's index. It might involve staying at the same index in the list for a while but eventually the actual right element will make it there and I'll be able to move forward. And that's what I did. Worked
