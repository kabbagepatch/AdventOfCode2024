I'll admit the first part is kinda ineffecient. I didn't use maps like I could've to make things quicker or better. But with the triple loop of pairs of one pc's connections and through one of their connections, it worked

For part 2, I removed my existing code because I knew it would do nothing for this part. Instead, I actually used maps to keep track of connections, mostly for ease of checking if a pc is in another's connection list. Then I used recursion to get the longest connection for a PC given a set of existing connections. If the PC doesn't connect to one of the existing ones, just return that existing connection list. If it does connect to all exisitng connections, check the other connections of that PC to see if the chain goes longer. This solution was slowwwwww. But I added a map for memoization. Then, after a couple minutes, I had my answer
