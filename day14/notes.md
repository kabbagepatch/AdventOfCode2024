Well that was something. The first problem was quite simple. Just used some basic maths to get the fianl positions of al robots and calculated how many in each quadrant.

The second part was vague. Very vague. In the end, what worked for me was finding an unusually long line of robots. Turns out they only got in a line longer than 10 once in the first 10,000 seconds. And that's when they made the tree
