String parsing is fun. But what's even more fun is regex. Made life so much easier and makes me wonder how many previous AoC problems could've been simplified with them.

Just had to define a quick pattern for "mul(number,number)" and part one was easy enough. Had to learn how to use regex in C++ though

Part two was a little tricky at first but then another regex, "do()stuffdon't()", gave me what I need. And then instead of worrying about handling the beginnign and end using regex, I just added a do() to the beginning and a don't() to the end. Ezpz
