# Advent Of Code 2024

Language: C++

Each day folder has a part 1 and part 2 folder in it, with the code file(s), along with the compiled versions. The puzzle input and any test inputs are in their own files. There's also a notes file which I write into after solving a puzzle, going through my thought process. Sometimes it has all the details nicely laid out, but mostly it's probably too hard to read even for me after a few months haha

Each .cpp file is a copy of the template file which has the main method to read the file input, and some helper methods; anything I found myself needing or using often. The Makefile helps automate some of the folder creation and copying things around
