Another robot moving around problem. But this time, with boxes. Part one was simple enough. I had some switch statements to handle the different directions, and a while loop for boxes in case there's multiple in a two in a particular direction

Part two doubled the problem. And my while loop turned into a recursive function, checking if all the boxes above/below the current box can move. And if they can, move 'em. The left-right logic didn't change.
