This was quite the journey. Part one immediately reminded me of the intcode problems of the past. Good times. It was quite simple to implement.

Part 2 was something else. The whole "reverse engineering" the program proved to be quite challenging. I went through quite a few ways, manually first, then some code before I came up with a recursive function, that tries a few possiblities that would lead you to an A register value to the program as the output. The big issue in reversing the program was compensating for the losses in information, like registers being overwritten, and the % operator. Therefore, the recursive function. Because a solution that works partially for the input might not work for the whole thing. And there might be multiple solutions to get to multiple stages
